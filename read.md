This tool is meant for static malware analysis. In order to get more useful information delve into the code itself,
and see how the code actually executes and what is affected by the malware (if not already obvious).

I implement PEfile and yara, and created my first ever yara rule (ransom.yara). PEfile is used to grab basic
information about the malware metadata as well as any warnings that can be found, and checks for dlls the code
accesses/modifies.
