# Static-Malware-Analysis

Static malware analysis is defined as "examining any given malware sample without actually running or executing the code.

# Tool usage

This tool implements argparser, after cloning the file use the command "python3 malwarecheck.py -h" to see what arguments must 
be input for the tool to run. This tool implements yara, pefile, and ssdeep for fuzzyhash comparison.

# Created files

malwarecheck.py creates many different files with useful information in all of them, make sure to check out the files that are created
by the program (examiner.csv, executive.csv, info.json, hashes.csv, fuzzyhashlist.csv, warnings.json). The most useful information
gets put into examiner.csv, and info.json but all the information is printed to the command line in case you like viewing command line 
better.

# In progrss

This tool is currently actively being developed. Feel free to reach out with suggestions on what else to add https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudosu/
