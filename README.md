# Static-Malware-Analysis

Static malware analysis is defined as examining any given malware sample without actually running or executing the code.

# Tool usage

This tool implements argparser, after cloning the file use the command "python3 malwarecheck.py -h" to see what arguments can be input into the program. Utilizes PEfile, yara, ssdeep, and has the abiltiy to calculate file entropy.

# Created files

malwarecheckenhanced.py creates many different files with useful information in all of them.The tool also prints the information to the terminal interface.

# In progrss
Adding more PEFile information,
Creating a webserver so people can upload single malware samples and recieve a downloaded document with the useful information.
This tool is currently actively being developed. Feel free to reach out with suggestions on what else to add https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudosu/
