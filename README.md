# Static-Malware-Analysis

Static malware analysis is defined as "examining any given malware sample without actually running or executing the code.

# Tool usage

This tool implements argparser, after cloning the file use the command "python3 malwarecheck.py -h" to see what arguments must 
be input for the tool to run. This tool implements yara, pefile, and ssdeep for fuzzyhash comparison.

# Created files

malwarecheck.py creates many different files with useful information in all of them, make sure to check out the files that are created
by the program (examiner.csv, executive.csv, info.json, hashes.csv, fuzzyhashlist.csv, warnings.json, prefetchdata.csv). The most useful information
gets put into examiner.csv, and info.json but all the information is printed to the command line in case you like viewing command line 
better.


# Recently Added

Made it so if a rule doesn't get triggered it doesnt show up in the csv/json file (examiner or executive).                                          
Removed now features a list of file names that get truncated instead of a bunch of statements to truncate them individually.                                             
Worked more on prefetch data, still havent gotten it to where I want though so some parts are docstringed out.                                
Fixed an error with Fuzzyhashing, it used to hash the filename instead of the file itself, now it hashes the full file.
